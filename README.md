### For :
L1 = 1.2,
L2 = 0.5,

For N=5,

Xi = -0.5,
Yi = 1.3,

Xf = 1.2,
Yf = -0.6, 

Where :

L1 and L2 represent the lengths of link 1 and link 2, respectively.

N denotes the number of Simulated Pathway Checkpoints.

Xi and Yi refer to the coordinates of the trajectory's initial point.

Xf and Yf denote the coordinates of the trajectory's final point.

### The result:
